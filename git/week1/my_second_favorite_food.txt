Rice – A long grain rice (I use basmati).
Potatoes – Any potato is fine — Russet and Yukon Gold are most common. The most important thing is that the slices are no more than ½ thick.
Green Beans – Fresh are preferred here.
Ground Protein – You can make lubia polo with beef, lamb, or a combination of the two. The meat is seasoned with salt, pepper, and:
Advieh Seasoning – A Persian spice mix that’s sweet, bold, and savory. Curry powder is the best substitute.
Cayenne Pepper – Substitute with chili powder, red pepper flakes, or — for a milder flavor — paprika.
Cinnamon – A warm, sweet, and earthy spice. Substitute with nutmeg, allspice, or clove. 
Cumin – Another warm spice with more of a citrusy, nutty taste. Substitute with ground coriander if necessary. 
Saffron – This sweet, floral ingredient becomes even sweeter when it’s cooked. It also becomes beautifully earthy, so it’s outstanding in complex savory dishes like lubia.
